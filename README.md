## What's in the box

### Read the Gemfiles

We have two Gemfiles. Both Gemfiles are annotaed with the description of what's included and links to each Gem's homepage for further details.

- The default `Gemfile` contains all the `production` group Gems.

- The `config/sensibles/Gemfile` contains all the `development` & `test` group Gems.
